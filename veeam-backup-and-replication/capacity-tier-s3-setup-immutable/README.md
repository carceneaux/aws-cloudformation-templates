# Capacity Tier S3 Setup with Immutability

[Veeam Capacity Tier](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/capacity_tier_how_it_works.html) expands the scale-out backup repository abilities and allows you to store backup data in cloud-based object storage or S3-Compatible on-premises storage.

This CloudFormation Template deploys the required AWS constructs to add an object storage backup repository **with Immutability** to Veeam Backup & Replication. It performs the following actions:

* Creates a S3 Bucket
* Creates an IAM User
  * User only has minimal access to the newly created S3 Bucket
* Template `Outputs` provide the following information:
  * **Region:** AWS Region
  * **User:** Newly created IAM user
  * **AccessKey:** AWS Access Key Id of new user
    * [Used for Veeam Credentials](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/amazon_repository_account.html)
  * **SecretKey:** AWS Secret Access Key of new user
    * [Used for Veeam Credentials](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/amazon_repository_account.html)
  * **S3Bucket:** Newly created S3 bucket
