# AWS CloudFormation Templates

This repository contains the AWS CloudFormation templates that I've written for various use cases. Documentation, including usage instructions, can be found with each CloudFormation template.

[AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) provides a common language for you to model and provision AWS and third party application resources in your cloud environment. AWS CloudFormation allows you to use programming languages or a simple text file to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, all the resources needed for your applications across all regions and accounts. This gives you a single source of truth for your AWS and third party resources.
